  "course_name": "Python for Scientists and Engineers - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "If you're a scientist or an engineer interested in learning scientific computing, this is the place to start.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn to write your own useful code to perform impactful scientific computations. Along the way, your understanding will be tested with periodic quizzes and exercises.\n\nTopics covered in this course include arrays, plotting, linear equations, symbolic computation, scientific algorithms, and random variables. Youâ€™ll also be exposed to popular Python packages like NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and others. In the last part of the course, the application section will test your ability to recall and apply the tools you have studied into newly learned scientific concepts.\n\nAt the end of this course, you'll be equipped with the tools necessary for everyday scientific computation.",
