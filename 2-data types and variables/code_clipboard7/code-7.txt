superman = "Clark Kent"

first = superman[0] # Accessing the first character
print (first) 

space = superman[5] # Accessing the empty space in the string
print (space) 

last = superman[len(superman) - 1]
print (last)

# err = superman[len(superman)] This will produce an error since the index is out of bounds
